    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
	<p>
		This is the final project for a programming course (IAT 265- Multimedia Programming for Art and Design) in SFU, and it was to be completed individually. The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive simulation that requires users’ input to complete, and it should not be a game. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For this project I made a simulation of interactions between the user and characters on screen. I thought of different themes for it, but I settled with interaction between a florist and customers. I started the ideation process by making sketches. I was thinking of a cafe environment at first, so the main character’s outfit reflects that (the charcter in blue in sketches). On top of that, I also drew some items that can be used in a flower shop setting, and that basically finalized the main interactions and events of this simulation. In one of the sketches is the draft for what states the entire interaction is needed and what to do during the main events.

		Next is the interface of the simulation. Figure 6-8 are the initial sketches that determine how the programme visually looks like. I took a more visual novel approach in this with text boxes and character avatar to convey emotion because I would like to put some storytelling elements in this project. In those sketches I put some annotation for what will be present on screen and if there will be feedback with the user clicked or hovered over those elements.  Figure 7 also has some notes on what to code in order to make it interactable. I marked in the figure the bounding box of the character and the items, and the way I expect it to detect each other so that the character has to be close to the items or customers to interact with them.

		I created all images in Procreate, then I used Adobe After Effects to help me animate the background and characters with their puppet tool (figure 9). At first I was going to use perlin noise to create some sort of textured background behind the windows to make it more interesting. However, as the computer is constantly generating patterns that makes the programme runs really slow, so I decided to replace it by a plain background that changes in order to indicate time, such as in figure 10 it is in the evening stage. Although it is not what I planned at the start, the changing color for the background makes the programme look more natural because it helps with the storytelling part when it conveys passages of time. Perhaps next time I can expand more on the narrative, such as more dialogues and optional actions that does not really affect the whole experience, but those actions enhance it nonetheless.
